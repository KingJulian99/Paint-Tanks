Paint Tanks

Paint System
Skeleton of implimentation came from TNTC at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUWfHX_ZNCw (notable the shader specific method)
With alterations by us to get it into a working and usable state for the other mechanics.

AI Systems
Components for the AI systems were implemented using an extention of Unity's NavMesh system: the NavMeshComponents system for 
building NavMeshs at runtime. The components can be found at https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents. The AI system
uses the NavMeshSurface component to build the NavMesh when loading the map at runtime.

.wavs
FREE Sound assets were all taken from unity asset store. Licenses for these sounds can be found in Assets/SFX.
Only ~8 .wavs were used.

Art
Thanks to Dall-e-2 for making the endscreen splash art ("winner!") and the paint tank background art.
For free of course.
