Paint Tanks

Paint System
Skeleton of implimentation came from TNTC at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUWfHX_ZNCw (notable the shader specific method)
With alterations by us to get it into a working and usable state for the other mechanics.

.wavs
FREE Sound assets were all taken from unity asset store. Licenses for these sounds can be found in Assets/SFX.
Only ~8 .wavs were used.

Art
Thanks to Dall-e-2 for making the endscreen splash art ("winner!") and the paint tank background art.
For free of course.
